Our game is Dinosaur themed and has 6 pieces.

The first piece is Turtle (T), which implements Drawable. The Turtle doesn't move or interact and when too
many dinosaurs come out, he gets scared and hides in his shell.

We have 3 moveable pieces: T-Rex (R), Pterodactyl (p), and Stegosaurus (S).
 - When the player moves to a spot one space away from the T-Rex, the T-Rex kills him. The player can be in the
   same spot as the T-Rex, though, because if he is standing under the T-Rex, the T-Rex doesn't know where he is.
 - The Pterodactyl moves away from the player as he comes closer but if the player catches the Pterodactyl or gets
   within one space of it, he wins a prize.
 - The Stegosaurus moves randomly about the game board and the player wins a prize if he lands on or gets within
   one space of the stegosaurus.

Our final 2 pieces are the Velociraptor (V) and the Brachiosaurus (B).
 - The Velociraptor is a hit if the player gets within one space of him or lands on him.
 - The Brachiosaurus stays in place and advances the player to the next level when the player lands on top of him.

Summary:
 - T-Rex : KILL
 - Pterodactyl : PRIZE
 - Brachiosaurus : ADVANCE
 - Velociraptor : HIT
 - Stegosaurus : PRIZE
 - Turtle : NONE
